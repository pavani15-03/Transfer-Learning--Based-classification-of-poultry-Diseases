# Transfer-Learning--Based-classification-of-poultry-Diseases
This internship project focuses on classifying poultry diseases using transfer learning. By fine-tuning pre-trained CNN models like ResNet50, the system can identify whether a poultry image is healthy or diseased (e.g., rotten) with high accuracy. The project includes a Flask-based web app for real-time image prediction
